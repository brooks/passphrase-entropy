Ruby Entropy is an algorithm for evaluating the robustness of passphrases. The algorithm uses standard entropy to calculate a base passphrase strength and then reduces that strength based on repeatability patterns, keyboard patterns, and several weak passphrase tests.

Documentation and gem is available <a href="https://github.com/broppler/ruby-entropy">here</a>.
